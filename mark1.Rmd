##### **Solving quadratic equations**

Consider equations of the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$. This is a quadratic equation; changing the values a,b, and c, changes the shape of the quadratic. There are two solutions to a quadratic equation:

$$x=\dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$ Let's draw a quadratic curve for different values of a,b and c.

```{r include = TRUE}
a <- 10
b <- 3
c <- -5
x <- seq(-2,2, length = 1e3)
fx <- a*x^2 + b*x + c
plot(x , fx , type = 'l' , xlab = "x" , ylab = "Quadratic function")
# addinf line for solution
abline(h=0 , lty = 2, col = "red")
```

In the above, we can also change the way the plots appears. I will return the above code, without displaying the code, and only producng the plot of figure height "4" units and the figure width "4"units

```{r include = TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4 , fig.width=4 , fig.align='center'}
a <- 10
b <- 3
c <- -5
x <- seq(-2,2, length = 1e3)
fx <- a*x^2 + b*x + c
plot(x , fx , type = 'l' , xlab = "x" , ylab = "Quadratic function")
# addinf line for solution
abline(h=0 , lty = 2, col = "red")

```


##### **Studying the Cricket dataset**
We will study the cricket dataset more closely now. The battingbowling.csv file in your repository contains information regarding various potential all-rounders in men's ODI cricket. The players' batting average, bowling average, and team  is present in the dataset.

We will ake a few visualizations. But first, we will need a few libraries.
```{r echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tibble)
```

Let's load the data and convert it into a tibble.
```{r tibble ,echo=TRUE}
cric <- read.csv("battingbowling.csv")
cric <- as_tibble(cric)
```
